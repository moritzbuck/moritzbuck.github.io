# Moritz Buck --- Metagenomics and stuff!
---

Hi,

This is my little public webspace.

I am Moritz, researcher. My main interests lies in microbial diversity, which I study mostly through the lens of metagenomics in aquatic systems. I have an engineering degree in "bioinformatics and modelling", a PhD in computer sciences (trying to evolve multicellularity in computer simulated "bacteria"), a first post-doc doing systems biology of mouse kidneys with micro-array transciptomics (the best ones stray...), before coming to my true love.

I am mostly known around my department as the guy who knows how to use a computer. I have been doing
