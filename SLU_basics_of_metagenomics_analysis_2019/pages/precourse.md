# Pre-course Material
---

It will be important for all participants to be somewhat familiar and comfortable in the use of the command-line and basic terminal commands. To refresh everyones memory we would appreciate if all course participant go through the following tutorials before the dates of the course.

Additionally, the course will run on the Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (e.g. UPPMAX), so in the second part of this pre-course material you will applied what you refreshed in the first part, by makeing sure your account is properly setup on UPPMAX.

## Unix/Linux Tutorial

**The three first part from the [UNIX Tutorial for Beginners](../../ngsintro/common/unixtut/)**  

* [**Introduction**](https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/ngsintro/common/unixtut/unixintro.html)  
* [**chapter 1**](https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/ngsintro/common/unixtut/unix1.html)  
* [**chapter 2**](https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/ngsintro/common/unixtut/unix2.html)  

You can use [http://uppnex.se/emu/](http://uppnex.se/emu/) [(or this mirror)](http://bellard.org/jslinux/) to try the commands in the tutorial, or of course your own terminal if you can find it.

* Using Linux is often the hardest part of the course, so being familiar with writing things on a command-line will help.  
You should at least go through the exercises in the tutorial, no need to know it by heart.  

## Using UPPMAX

* Make sure that you can login to UPPMAX from your computer before the course starts. Follow these instructions: 
[http://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/guide--first-login-to-uppmax/](http://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/guide--first-login-to-uppmax/) 

* It is possible to use Mac, Unix/Linux or Windows. (Windows will require installing a special program that you'll find in the instructions.)  

* Create a file with your UPPMAX-username in `/proj/g2019027/public/` with the `touch` command:

```
touch /proj/g2019027/public/YOUR_USERNAME_FOR_UPPMAX
```
